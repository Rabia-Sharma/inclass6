 One of the strongest arguments defending the notion that progressive enhancement ought to be the traditional model where content is always accessible is the following quote:
> The web is not for anyone, it’s for everyone.
> PE: past, present, and future


  On the other hand, those who take the view that progressive enhancement has changed such that JS running on a browser can be safely assumed and that the network is now the enhancement will argue:
  
  > I hope we’ll see more examples of Progressive Web Apps that don’t require JavaScript to render content.


According to my point of view:
Render the center piece of the site server-side (and obviously this should likewise be possible with JavaScript, eg. Node.js) on first view. From that point on you can render extra substance with JavaScript. What's more, obviously you can upgrade the normal connections on your site and can utilize JavaScript to advances between pages. Never endeavor to impersonate local HTML with JavaScript. Accessility ought to dependably could easily compare to execution or different limitations. Use JavaScript, yet utilize it carefully and don't expect it will dependably work.
